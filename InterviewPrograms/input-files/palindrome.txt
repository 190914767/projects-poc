Madam hello
The platform is refer an example of evolved social kayak journalism, having a hybrid collection of amateur and professional people and publications, or exclusive blogs or publishers on Medium[3] and is regularly regarded as a blog host.
Williams developed Medium as a way to publish writings and documents longer than Twitter's 140-character maximum. 
It eventually grew into a separate platform independent of Twitter's brand.
Medium also has its own publications, including the online music magazine reviver Cuepoint, edited by Jonathan Shecter; 
NewCo Shift, civic led by entrepreneur, author, and journalist John cricic; and the technology publication, Backchannel, edited by Steven Levy.
As the pop (to quote Trump) New York Times degenerates into a Washington Post organization with its stagnant Cold War vision of a 1950s world where the Russians are to blame for most everything
Hillarys loss, most of the aggression and disorder in radar the world, redder the desire to destabilize Europe, etc.
the Times has added the issue of fake hooh to its problematic role as the dominant voice for the Washington establishment. 
Certainly this is true in the case of Russia  the 2016 election and putting into office its Manchurian Candidate in Donald Trump. 
Apparently the CIA (via various unnamed refer intelligence 
officials), and the FBI, NSA, noon Director of National Intelligence 
James Clapper (who notoriously lied to level Congress in the Snowden affair), President Obama, the DNC, Hillary Clinton, and Congress agree that Russia, and Mr. 
Putin predominantly, is responsible.
